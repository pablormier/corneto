---

CORNETO is a Python framework for inferring biological networks from omics data by framing them as optimisation problems. It provides a unified, flexible, and extensible API to solve a wide range of network inference problems, including signalling pathway and metabolic model reconstruction.

## Why CORNETO?

| Feature | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| üß© **Unified optimisation core** | Express causal signaling, FBA, PCSF & more with the same primitives. |
| üéØ **Exact, solver-backed answers** | LP/MILP formulations guarantee optimality‚Äîno more heuristic guesswork. |
| üìä **Multi-sample power** | Borrow strength across conditions for cleaner, comparable subnetworks. |
| üîß **Modular & extensible** | Plug-in new constraints, priors, or scoring functions in a few lines of code. |
| ‚ö° **Blazing-fast** | Supports CVXPY and PICOS backends with dozens of solvers. |



## üöÄ Installation

The standard installation for CORNETO is via pip:

```bash
pip install corneto
```

This provides the core functionalities of the package. For visualization, some users might need to install `graphviz`. For `conda` users, we recommend installing it via:

```bash
conda install python-graphviz
```

### Optional dependencies

For more advanced use cases, CORNETO provides optional dependencies that can be installed as extras. For example, to install the dependencies for research, which includes the Gurobi solver, you can run:

```bash
pip install corneto[research]
```

Please refer to the documentation for a complete list of available extras and their descriptions.

### Gurobi Installation

For research problems, we strongly recommend using the Gurobi solver. Gurobi is a commercial solver that offers free academic licences. To install and configure Gurobi, please refer to the [official Gurobi documentation](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/). After installation, you can verify that Gurobi is correctly set up by running:

```python
from corneto.utils import check_gurobi
check_gurobi()
```

### Development Installation

If you plan to contribute to CORNETO, we recommend using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) for dependency management.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saezlab/corneto.git
cd corneto
poetry install --with dev
```

### Legacy Compatibility

The stable version used by [LIANA+](https://liana-py.readthedocs.io/) and [NetworkCommons](https://networkcommons.readthedocs.io/) remains available. However, we recommend using the latest version for new projects to access the latest features and improvements described in our manuscript.
