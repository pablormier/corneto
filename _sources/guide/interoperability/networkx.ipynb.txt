    "[**NetworkX**](https://networkx.org/) is an open-source Python library designed for creating, manipulating, and analyzing networks made up of nodes and edges. It provides an extensive array of tools and algorithms for general graph operations, catering to both directed and undirected graphs. Beyond basic graph creation and visualization, NetworkX supports a multitude of graph algorithms, ranging from shortest path computations to more complex structural evaluations, making it a versatile toolkit for researchers, developers, and data scientists working in the domain of network analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, CORNETO's `graph` class has a specialized focus. While NetworkX is geared towards using standard graph methods, CORNETO is all about building optimization problems using graphs. This makes CORNETO ideal for those who are looking to tackle specific optimization challenges using graph-based methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the differences in their primary uses, CORNETO and NetworkX can work together. CORNETO includes a feature, the `to_networkx` and `from_networkx` methods, that let users convert a CORNETO graph into a format compatible with NetworkX. This means users can enjoy the benefits of both libraries when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will see an example of this interoperability between CORNETO and NetworkX."
